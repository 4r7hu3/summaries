# Intent ðŸ“Œ

In several situations, it's awesome to have some easy-read, specific material about contents or tools we are constantly using, specially when we're on the rush. Therefore, this repo provides a few files for those times, serving as "fast guides" in the moments they're need. 

The files were entirely made in Markdown language through [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), which is a great editor.

I hope you find them useful :)
